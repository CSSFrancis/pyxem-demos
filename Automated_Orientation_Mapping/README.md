<h1> Automated Orientation Mapping </h1>

Currently in development, this README will constitute something approximating "Scientific Documentation" 

<h3> Overview and Philosophy </h3>

Template matching (first introduced in a TEM context in 2005) is a simple, intuitive approach to 
solving a STEM experiment that relies on the kinematic model and some further simplifying assumptions. For
computational reasons pyXem keeps the patterns (from an experiment, labelled as P in equations) and the
templates (T in equations) separate for as long as possible. When the finally do meet a loss function must be 
defined (see Section 3) and used. At this point one could claim to have solved the problem, but in fact much is
left to be done. Thus in Section 4 we discuss several additional tools for interpretation and error estimation. 

<h3> The Patterns </h3>

<h3> The Templates </h3> 

GOTCHA: markers don't care how intense the peak they are derived from is, so you get some odd things
